##  Mod18Challenge

Build a functional blockchain that eases and records transactions.

Deploy a blockchain as a usable web application.

Securely decentralize your blockchain through proof of work, which is a consensus algorithm that blockchain networks commonly use.

Build a shared record-keeping system.

Share the record-keeping system in a decentralized way.

Deploy the decentralized blockchain through a web application so that anyone can review and use it.
Built With


## Getting Started
 For this challenge build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Prerequisites
(Make sure you're on conda dev environment before installing streamlit)
